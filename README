Note on Versions and Dates of Versions:

This version, 2024.02, is the stable public release immediately following Version 0.9. (For all intents and purposes, this Version is equivalent to a Version 1.0, though there is no "Version 1.0".) For future stable releases, we will continue to number versions with the format YYYY.MM corresponding to the date of release, rather than an arbitrary version number. We also continue to make public our working files for IcePaHC here: https://github.com/antonkarl/icecorpus/tree/master/finished . Note that the files at the above link are UNSTABLE; we may modify these at any point, and caution users who wish to use them to review the version histories of the relevant files in that depository.
