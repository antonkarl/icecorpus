Note on Versions and Dates of Versions:

This version, 2024.03, is the stable public release immediately following Version 0.9. (For all intents and purposes, this version is equivalent to a Version 1.0, though there is no "Version 1.0".) For future stable releases, we will continue to number versions with the format YYYY.MM corresponding to the date of release, rather than an arbitrary version number. We also continue to make public our working files for IcePaHC here: <https://github.com/antonkarl/icecorpus/tree/master/finished>. Note that the files at the above link are UNSTABLE; we may modify these at any point, and caution users who wish to use them to review the version histories of the relevant files in that repository.

The Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus (IcePaHC) is a treebank that contains Icelandic texts organized by period. See the website, <http://linguist.is/wiki>, for further information. The texts found in this version are the same as in Version 0.9. However, various parsing, tagging and lemmatization corrections have been made and some typos have also been corrected.

IcePaHC contains .psd, .tagged, .txt and .info files:

– psd files contain the parsed text.
– tagged files contain the original text together with morphological tags (e.g., NS-A, VAN) and lemmas.
– txt files contain the raw text.
– info files contain information about the texts in the corpus.
