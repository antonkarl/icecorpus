1. What to do with raising verbs (vera, verða, fara, eiga, ætla, fá, taka)

2. Participles in NPs or in ADJPs with specifier (mjög, etc.), or
   in ADJP-SPR i.e. whether to treat them as VAN/VBN/VAG or as ADJ

3. Splitting of RPs/ADVs/etc. from participles

4. Postnominals; cf. (NP (N attorney) (ADJP (ADJ general)));
   Tentatively RESOLVED
   CONCLUSION: all post-head modifiers project a phrase

5. Complementless RP/ADV with specifier that correspond to PPs;
   e.g. fram í

6. Participle (not in NP/ADJP) describing result or state vs.
   current action; VAN/VBN/VAG vs. ADJ

7. Treatment of nema

8. Treatment of PP/CP-CMP where CP-CMP is/would be the complement of
   something which corresponds to a full phrase inside the CP-CMP,
   rather than a gap/trace, as in „Við vildum ráða annan/betri kokk
   en Guðmund.“ or „Við leituðum árangurslaust að jafngóðum kokki og
   Guðmundi.“

9. Rethink CP-EOP and CP-TMC

10. How to treat uninflected right adjuncts (especially numbers or
    letters) in NPs, e.g. years, hours of the clock, chapter, page
    and section numbers, house numbers; currently being put in
    NP-COM within another NP, with uninflected words not marked for
    case

11. Quantifier vs. adverb (mikið, lítið, svolítið, dálítið, nokkuð,
    lítið eitt, neitt, eitthvað, ekkert) and questions of NP-MSR vs.
    ADVP, also with nógu; also related issue with langt, skammt

12. Problems with heldur and enda (how to attach the IP starting with
    these words)

13. Negation and other things that look like IP constituents that seem
    to be within NP/ADJP/ADVP/PP, etc., often related to consideration of
    different possibilities (different actual or potential constituents
    that are contrasted); e.g. ekki, til dæmis, kannski; is a position
    within NP/ADJP/ADVP/PP allowed, and what is the default attachment?
    Also in CPs, e.g. einfaldlega, in a CP-CMP.
    
14. NP-CMP vs. simple NP in ADJP (ADVP?): jafn, samur, líkur, svipaður,
    áþekkur; compare to usage with CP-CMP
    
15. CP-ADV vs. CP-CMP (e.g. with sem ‘as, like’)
