# Created by Kristján Rúnarsson


1. What to do with raising verbs (vera, verða, fara, eiga, ætla, fá, taka)

2. Participles in NPs or in ADJPs with specifier (mjög, etc.), or
   in ADJP-SPR i.e. whether to treat them as VAN/VBN/VAG or as ADJ

3. Splitting of RPs/ADVs/etc. from participles

4. Postnominals; cf. (NP (N attorney) (ADJP (ADJ general)));
   Tentatively RESOLVED
   CONCLUSION: all post-head modifiers project a phrase
   (except clitic article after noun head)
   TWIST: what about andstöðuupptalningu þá hina miklu?

5. Complementless RP/ADV with specifier that correspond to PPs;
   e.g. fram í

6. Participle (not in larger NP/ADJP) describing result or state vs.
   current action; VAN/VBN/VAG vs. ADJ (single ADJ in its own ADJP or IP-PPL)
   Tentative solution: Wrap in an IP-PPL when describing result/state

7. Treatment of nema

8. Treatment of PP/CP-CMP where CP-CMP is/would be the complement of
   something which corresponds to a full phrase inside the CP-CMP,
   rather than a gap/trace, as in „Við vildum ráða annan/betri kokk
   en Guðmund.“ or „Við leituðum árangurslaust að jafngóðum kokki og
   Guðmundi.“

9. Rethink CP-EOP and CP-TMC
   One particularly difficult example:
   … til mikils að vinna að við reynum …

10. How to treat uninflected right adjuncts (especially numbers or
    letters) in NPs, e.g. years, hours of the clock, chapter, page
    and section numbers, house numbers; currently being put in
    NP-COM within another NP, with uninflected words not marked for
    case; consider also the case where these uninflected words are
    the only word in the NP, e.g. (NP 2013); consider case marking
    in NPs such as (NP árinu 2003) – one might be tempted to consider
    2003 an NP-PRN, but is it really dative (tvö þúsund og *þrjú*)?
    Examples in corpus also e.g. (PP frá 1973), (NP ársins 2013).

11. Quantifier vs. adverb (mikið, lítið, svolítið, dálítið, nokkuð,
    lítið eitt, neitt, eitthvað, ekkert) and questions of NP-MSR vs.
    ADVP, also with nógu, miklu, löngu; also related issue with langt,
    skammt, hátt, lágt; also N/ADV cases such as ósköp; other words that
    may be quantifiers, such as umtalsvert; consider also (WXP hvað)

12. Problems with heldur and enda (how to attach the IP starting with
    these words); consider also heldur within non-IP constituents
    SOLVED: put CONJP around second constituent, but still mark heldur
    and enda as ADV in ADVP and place the ADVP within the second constituent.
    Also applies to né in examples such as “Liðið mæti ekki bara til að vera
    með né láti [það] sér nægja gleðina ...” The same in English: “... nor does
    he make”, not “*nor he makes”

13. Negation and other things that look like IP constituents that seem
    to be within NP/ADJP/ADVP/PP, etc., often related to consideration of
    different possibilities (different actual or potential constituents
    that are contrasted); e.g. ekki, til dæmis, kannski; is a position
    within NP/ADJP/ADVP/PP allowed, and what is the default attachment?
    Also in CPs, e.g. einfaldlega, in a CP-CMP.

14. NP-CMP vs. simple NP in ADJP (ADVP?): jafn, samur, líkur, svipaður,
    áþekkur; compare to usage with CP-CMP

15. CP-ADV vs. CP-CMP (e.g. with sem ‘as, like’)

16. Adjective-like quantities in the form of a non-genitive noun phrase
    with some sort of unit of measurement as head, e.g. [núll prósent]
    virðisaukaskattur; might sometimes rather be the head of the outer
    phrase (eitt stykki tölvu); also with phrases with a NUM that is
    originally a noun, (e.g. tvö þúsund krónur). Perhaps this structure
    actually applies to all instances of hundrað/þúsund/milljón that have
    previously been analyzed as NUM? Compare also with issue 11, in particular
    noun intensifiers such as ósköp. 
    SOLVED: Use NP-CPD (except for number nouns, e.g. þúsund, for now)

17. Subclauses starting with þegar and síðan actually always have a gap (NP-TMP),
    so it is inappropriate to parse them as PP with CP-ADV without a gap.
    They should have exactly the same structure as þar sem clauses.
    Compare with the synonymous “þá er…”. Subclauses starting with meðan and uns are
    the same. Look at þar til…, þangað til… as well.
    Sometimes þegar að, meðan að, etc. Consider also eftir að, which has an obligatory
    C að, but is perhaps otherwise similar.
    Good example: 20. júní þegar undirbúningur hefst
    Compare issue 36

18. How to treat follow-up questions with only one constituent corresponding
    to the WXP in the previous question (but not itself a WXP).

19. Treatment of finite (independent) sentences in headline/telegraph style,
    where the verb BE or similar is omitted, similarly to IP-SMC.
    SOLVED: Analyse as IP-ABS.

20. Right node raising: the right sentence/constituent seems rather to be
    the dominant one, with a gap in the left one; it would be nice to indicate
    the role of the shared element in the left one by means of some sort of
    trace.

21. CP-QUE/CP-THT with an unclear relation to the verb, perhaps replaceable with a PP:
    hugsa sig um (með e-ð/hvort …), pæla (í e-u/hvort…), etc.
    sammála hv. þingmanni að 4. gr. gengur ekki upp

22. Standa vaktina, standa vörð, halda vörð (stand guard, keep watch), etc.

23. Nominalized non-nouns as head in NP, e.g. (NP (Q eitthvert) (QTP (CONJ en)))?
    Perhaps use -HEAD or similar to mark the QTP here?

24. Sentence-initial topic that has no relation to the verb. Should this be
    marked specially, or should it be its own FRAG?

25. Incomplete questions (e.g. of the form “Hvað ef …” or “Hvað með …”).
    SOLVED: Use FRAG instead of IP-SUB.

26. Should ADVP saman be marked somehow as a secondary predicate, e.g. þau gerðu þetta saman.

27. Should we differentiate between (W)D (or WQ?) and (W)PRO for hver?

28. What to do with multiword proper names, e.g. Samband íslenskra sveitarfélaga? Consider
    also long titles; ought they really be part of the proper name, e.g. 
    “hv. þingmanni og formanni atvinnuveganefndar, Jóni Gunnarssyni”
    
29. Should we separate instance count (oft, margoft, sjaldan, alltaf, tvisvar etc.)
    from temporal adverbs (nú, etc.)?
    
30. CP-DEG should likely be used in various additional circumstances: sometimes with SÁ,
    with FYRST (fyrst þú komst, etc.), definitely with SVO, etc.
    Perhaps also IP-INF-DEG in examples such as “tilfinningin að sitja í sófanum”
    
31. Titles as shared premodifiers, e.g. hv. þm. (plural) Ólína Þorvarðardóttir og
    Mörður Árnason
    
32. Phrasal compounds, e.g. 1–0 sigur.
    Proposed solution: tag the phrase used as the left component of a compound according
    to its inner structure/parts of speech and add the extra label -CPD: NP-CPD,
    ADVP-CPD, IP-IMP-CPD, etc., e.g. (NP (NP-CPD 1–0) (N-N sigur))
    This method should normally not be used if the left part is only a single word, e.g.
    “PGA meistaramótið”, in which case the modifier is merged with the noun head using N21
    and N22 encapsulated in a non-leaf N.
    Should NP-POS that are really part of a kind of compound noun be tagged NP-POS-CPD?
    e.g. (NP-POS-CPD iðnaðar- og landbúnaðar$) ($ráðherra), or even nested in
    (NP (NP-POS-CPD (NP-POS-CPD dóms- og kirkju$) (N-G $mála$)) (N-N $ráðherra))
    
    „final four“ fyrirkomulag??
    
33. Locative or origin/affiliation designations in the dative case: Leiknir Fáskrúðsfirði.
    Proposed solution: Tag as NP-LOC.
    
34. Complex adverbial/prepositional phrases (often temporal or locative), e.g.
    “nú rétt fyrir hádegi”, “hér á Alþingi”, “nú í dag”, “strax í dag”, “fyrr í dag”,
    “einmitt í dag”, “fyrir hádegi í dag”
    
35. CP-ADV with sem should be CP-CMP, e.g. “að hleypa Samfylkingunni og Vinstri grænum
    að, fyrst [sem minnihlutastjórn]”
    
36. Þangað til [þú komst], þar til …, need to be fixed. They should have (ADVP þangað/þar)
    as prepositional complement moved to spec-PP with the CP after the P head moved out of
    ADVP. That CP should probably be a CP-REL and needs to have a ADVP-TMP trace.
    Compare also þar til í mars with frá því í mars
    Compare also “Frá því Stefán varð níræður”
    NB: Frá því Stefán varð níræður could have a gap, frá því í mars could have a resumptive
    PP, another example with possible resumptive phrase is “frá því snemma árs 2011”
    Compare issue 17.
    
37. CP-REL in PP

38. Annað hvort NP-ADV: mætir annað hvort BATE Borisov í næstu umferð eða SJK Seinäjoki

39. allt í lagi should probably be IP-ABS
