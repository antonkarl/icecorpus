1. What to do with raising verbs (vera, verða, fara, eiga, ætla, fá, taka)

2. Participles in NPs or in ADJPs with specifier (mjög, etc.), or
   in ADJP-SPR i.e. whether to treat them as VAN/VBN/VAG or as ADJ

3. Splitting of RPs/ADVs/etc. from participles

4. Postnominals; cf. (NP (N attorney) (ADJP (ADJ general)));
   Tentatively RESOLVED
   CONCLUSION: all post-head modifiers project a phrase
   TWIST: what about andstöðuupptalningu þá hina miklu?

5. Complementless RP/ADV with specifier that correspond to PPs;
   e.g. fram í

6. Participle (not in larger NP/ADJP) describing result or state vs.
   current action; VAN/VBN/VAG vs. ADJ (single ADJ in its own ADJP)

7. Treatment of nema

8. Treatment of PP/CP-CMP where CP-CMP is/would be the complement of
   something which corresponds to a full phrase inside the CP-CMP,
   rather than a gap/trace, as in „Við vildum ráða annan/betri kokk
   en Guðmund.“ or „Við leituðum árangurslaust að jafngóðum kokki og
   Guðmundi.“

9. Rethink CP-EOP and CP-TMC

10. How to treat uninflected right adjuncts (especially numbers or
    letters) in NPs, e.g. years, hours of the clock, chapter, page
    and section numbers, house numbers; currently being put in
    NP-COM within another NP, with uninflected words not marked for
    case

11. Quantifier vs. adverb (mikið, lítið, svolítið, dálítið, nokkuð,
    lítið eitt, neitt, eitthvað, ekkert) and questions of NP-MSR vs.
    ADVP, also with nógu, miklu, löngu; also related issue with langt,
    skammt, hátt, lágt; also N/ADV cases such as ósköp; other words that
    may be quantifiers, such as umtalsvert

12. Problems with heldur and enda (how to attach the IP starting with
    these words); consider also heldur within non-IP constituents

13. Negation and other things that look like IP constituents that seem
    to be within NP/ADJP/ADVP/PP, etc., often related to consideration of
    different possibilities (different actual or potential constituents
    that are contrasted); e.g. ekki, til dæmis, kannski; is a position
    within NP/ADJP/ADVP/PP allowed, and what is the default attachment?
    Also in CPs, e.g. einfaldlega, in a CP-CMP.
    
14. NP-CMP vs. simple NP in ADJP (ADVP?): jafn, samur, líkur, svipaður,
    áþekkur; compare to usage with CP-CMP
    
15. CP-ADV vs. CP-CMP (e.g. with sem ‘as, like’)

16. Adjective-like quantities in the form of a non-genitive noun phrase
    with some sort of unit of measurement as head, e.g. [núll prósent]
    virðisaukaskattur; might sometimes rather be the head of the outer
    phrase (eitt stykki tölvu)

17. Subclauses starting with þegar actually always have a gap (NP-TMP),
    so it is inappropriate to parse them as PP with CP-ADV without a gap.
    They should have exactly the same structure as þar sem clauses.

18. How to treat follow-up questions with only one constituent corresponding
    to the WXP in the previous question.

19. Treatment of finite (independent) sentences in headline/telegraph style,
    where the verb BE or similar is omitted, similarly to IP-SMC.
